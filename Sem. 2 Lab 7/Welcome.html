					<span class="small">Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. 
					<br><br>
					According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:
					<br><br>
					A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.</span>

			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
				<div class="p-3 rowBuffer2">
					<h3 class="aligner">Once a container is in place, other Bootstrap layout components implement a CSS grid layout through defining rows and columns.</h3>

				<div class="p-3 rowBuffer2">
				<h3 class="aligner red">An open-source framework</h3>
				<span class="red">
				Bootstrap is also known as a Front-end-framework.<br><br>

				Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you will see some funky incomplete styling, but including it should not cause any considerable hiccups. Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Originally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, Bootstrap has since had over twenty releases, including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. Bootstrap 2 added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that, Bootstrap 3 rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.
