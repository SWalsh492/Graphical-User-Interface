	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup 
	language.
	</p>
	<p id="para2">
	CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can 
	control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
	</p>
	<p id="para3">
	All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. 
	The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and 
	the actual content.
	</p>
	<p id="para4">
	A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block: The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The 
	declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name 
	and a value, separated by a colon.

	<p id="para5">
	A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
	</p>
	<p id="para6">
	With CSS3, you can give any element "rounded corners", by using the border-radius property.
	</p>
	<p id="para7">
	With the CSS3 border-image property, you can set an image to be used as the border around an element.
	</p>
	<p id="para8">
	The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around content. The padding properties set the size of the white space 
	between the element content and the element border.
